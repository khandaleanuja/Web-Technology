console.log(true);
-> Output : true
   true is Boolean so no conversion is applied. Therefore it is printed as it is.

console.log(+ true);
-> Output : 1
   + converts the value to Number
   true -> 1
   false -> 0
 
console.log(+ "")
-> Output : 0
   + converts the value to Number
   "" (empty string) converts to 0
