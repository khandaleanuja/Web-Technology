1) What is mean by NodeJS ?
---->  Used to run the JS code outside the browser.


DataTypes : 
1) Primitive  --> There are 7 primitive data types
   Number, string, undefined, Boolean, NULL, symbol, begin

2) Non-Primitive --> Object, array, function


Variable declaration :
   let, var, const

   const a = 12;
   let b = 20;
   var c = 30;


Difference between let, var, const :
   const -> value not changed
   let -> it gives real value to output
   var -> it gives changed value to output
